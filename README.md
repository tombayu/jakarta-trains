# jakarta-trains
All about Jakarta's growing train networks!
Below is a map generated using the data in the repo, combined with the data from my other [Transjakarta](https://github.com/tombayu/Transjakarta) repo. I intend to show the feeder buses 'feeding' the MRT lines. However, it's not currently showing the depiction I'm hoping it would show (i.e. massive stream of feeders going into the main MRT line), so a lot of improvements are to be made. It could be in my visualization technique, or perhaps by adding more routes/feeders *poking Transjakarta* :-) 

Some credits: Trafi for the API, BIG for the shapefiles, [rasyidstat](https://github.com/rasyidstat/transjakarta) for the great repo allowing me to learn how to parse an API using R!
